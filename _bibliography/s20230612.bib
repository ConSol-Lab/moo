abstract="This paper considers real-time dispatching for large-scale ride-sharing services over a rolling horizon. It presents RTDARS which relies on a column-generation algorithm to minimize wait times while guaranteeing short travel times and service for each customer. Experiments using historic taxi trips in New York City for instances with upÂ to 30,000 requests per hour indicate that the algorithm scales well and provides a principled and effective way to support large-scale ride-sharing services in dense cities.",
