    abstract = { We present a method for solving the independent set formulation of the graph coloring problem (where there is one variable for each independent set in the graph). We use a column generation method for implicit optimization of the linear program at each node of the branch-and-bound tree. This approach, while requiring the solution of a difficult subproblem as well as needing sophisticated branching rules, solves small to moderate size problems quickly. We have also implemented an exact graph coloring algorithm based on DSATUR for comparison. Implementation details and computational experience are presented. }

    abstract = { Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and column generation, devised for linear programs, is a success story in large-scale integer programming. We outline and relate the approaches, and survey mainly recent contributions, not yet found in textbooks. We emphasize the growing understanding of the dual point of view, which has brought considerable progress to the column generation theory and practice. It stimulated careful initializations, sophisticated solution techniques for the restricted master problem and subproblem, as well as better overall performance. Thus, the dual perspective is an ever recurring concept in our “selected topics.” }
