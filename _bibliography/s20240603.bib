We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a new model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We propose Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models, and develop Cost-Algebraic A* Solver for DyPDL (CAASDy), a generic solver for DyPDL using state space search. We formalize existing problem-specific DP and state space search methods for combinatorial optimization problems as DP models in DyPDL. Using CAASDy and commercial MIP and CP solvers, we experimentally compare the DP models with existing MIP and CP models, showing that, despite its nascent nature, CAASDy outperforms MIP and CP on a number of common problem classes.}, number={1}, journal={Proceedings of the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling}, author={Kuroiwa, Ryo and Beck, J.
