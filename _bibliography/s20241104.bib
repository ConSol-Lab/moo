               Inverse optimization (IO) is used to model the behavior of
               decision-making agents who solve optimization problems in
               response to external signals. Inspired by the geometry of IO
               problems, in ``Learning in Inverse Optimization: Incenter Cost,
               Augmented Suboptimality Loss, and Algorithms,'' Zattoni
               Scroccaro, Atasoy, and Mohajerin Esfahani propose the
               ``incenter'' concept to solve IO problems, which unlike
               previously proposed approaches, can be used to derive
               computationally tractable solutions to this modeling problem.
               Moreover, they also propose a novel loss function for IO problems
               and a tailored optimization algorithm to optimize it. Extensive
               numerical experiments showcase the improved efficiency and
               accuracy of the proposed IO formulations and algorithm.",

  abstract  = "We propose a method for learning decision makers' behavior in
               routing problems using inverse optimization (IO). The IO
               framework falls into the supervised learning category and builds
               on the premise that the target behavior is an optimizer of an
               unknown cost function. This cost function is to be learned
               through historical data, and in the context of routing problems,
               can be interpreted as the routing preferences of the decision
               makers. In this view, the main contributions of this study are to
               propose an IO methodology with a hypothesis function, loss
               function, and stochastic first-order algorithm tailored to
               routing problems. We further test our IO approach in the Amazon
               Last Mile Routing Research Challenge, where the goal is to learn
               models that replicate the routing preferences of human drivers,
               using thousands of real-world routing examples. Our final
               IO-learned routing model achieves a score that ranks second
               compared with the 48 models that qualified for the final round of
               the challenge. Our examples and results showcase the flexibility
               and real-world potential of the proposed IO methodology to learn
               from decision-makers' decisions in routing problems. History:
