  abstract  = "Maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT), employing propositional logic as
               the declarative language of choice, has turned into a viable
               approach to solving NP-hard optimization problems arising from
               artificial intelligence and other real-world settings. A key
               contributing factor to the success of MaxSAT is the rise of
               increasingly effective exact solvers that are based on iterative
               calls to a Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver. The three types
               of SAT-based MaxSAT solving approaches, each with its
               distinguishing features, implemented in current state-of-the-art
               MaxSAT solvers are the core-guided, the implicit hitting set
               (IHS), and the objective-bounding approaches. The
               objective-bounding approach is based on directly searching over
               the objective function range by iteratively querying a SAT solver
               if the MaxSAT instance at hand has a solution under different
               bounds on the objective. In contrast, both core-guided and IHS
               are so-called unsatisfiability-based approaches that employ a SAT
               solver as an unsatisfiable core extractor to determine sources of
               inconsistencies, but critically differ in how the found
               unsatisfiable cores are made use of towards finding a provably
               optimal solution. Furthermore, a variety of different algorithmic
               variants of the core-guided approach in particular have been
               proposed and implemented in solvers. It is well-acknowledged that
               each of the three approaches has its advantages and
               disadvantages, which is also witnessed by instance and
               problem-domain specific runtime performance differences (and at
               times similarities) of MaxSAT solvers implementing variants of
               the approaches. However, the questions of to what extent the
               approaches are fundamentally different and how the benefits of
               the individual methods could be combined in a single algorithmic
               approach are currently not fully understood. In this work, we
               approach these questions by developing UniMaxSAT, a general
               unifying algorithmic framework. Based on the recent notion of
               abstract cores, UniMaxSAT captures in general core-guided, IHS
               and objective-bounding computations. The framework offers a
               unified way of establishing quite generally the correctness of
               the current approaches. We illustrate this by formally showing
               that UniMaxSAT can simulate the computations of various
               algorithmic instantiations of the three types of MaxSAT solving
               approaches. Furthermore, UniMaxSAT can be instantiated in novel
               ways giving rise to new algorithmic variants of the approaches.
               We illustrate this aspect by developing a prototype
               implementation of an algorithmic variant for MaxSAT based on the
               framework.",
