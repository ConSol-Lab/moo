In this talk I will discuss the paper "Unifying SAT-Based Approaches to Maximum Satisfiability Solving"; the paper explores the differences between the 3 different approaches to MaxSAT (core-guided search, implicit hitting sets and objective bounding) and to what extent they are different.

Each of the 3 aforementioned approaches has its strengths and weaknesses but it is poorly understood in what sense they fundamentally differ and how they could potentially be combined. To this end, the paper proposes a new framework, UniMaxSAT, for unifying these approaches and shows that all 3 approaches can be simulated using this framework. Additionally, the paper shows that this framework can be used to create new variants of the 3 approaches.
