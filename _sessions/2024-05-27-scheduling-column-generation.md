The employee scheduling problem has found many applications in multiple different fields like hospital scheduling or tour scheduling. Over the years many different variants with their own models and constraints appeared, specifically tailored to the individual needs of the problem origin. In 2019, a general version of this problem, combining many of the pre-existing constraints into a single all-encompassing schema. Due to previous successes of column generation on different versions of employee scheduling problems, this research aims to apply a column generation method on the general version of the problem. To accomplish this, a mathematical model of the schema has been developed as well as its decomposition into multiple master and sub-problems. Three avenues are to be explored by splitting the problem in any of the following ways: by employee, by shift, or by day and the effects each of these splits will have on the quality of the solutions.
