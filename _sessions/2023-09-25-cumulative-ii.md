In this session, as a continuation of the previous session, I will go over one of the hybrid propagators consisting of the combination of edge-finding and time-table reasoning (Time-table edge-finding). Next, I will briefly go over LCG solving and why explanations are a crucial factor for these types of solvers. Finally, we will take a look at the explanations for time-table propagators, edge-finding propagators and the hybrid time-table edge-finding propagator.
