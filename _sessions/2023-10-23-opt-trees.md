In this session I will:
<ol>
<li>introduce how Dynamic Programming can be used to optimize decision trees (Emir's work);</li>
<li>give some intuition why for this specific problem a custom DP formulation outperforms MIP, CP and (max)SAT;</li>
<li>show how this approach can be generalized to other optimization tasks (my work); and</li>
<li>present some of the challenges encountered with optimal decision trees, such as binarization and overfitting (current/future work).</li>
</ol>
