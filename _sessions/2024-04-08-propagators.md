We will discuss several global constraints and their corresponding propagation algorithms, explanations, and usage. Apart from the learning aspect of this session, my aim is also to connect these global constraints to your work, and hopefully spark some brainstorming!

We have a long list of globals, and depending on time constraints we may also consider a subset: 'all-different', 'circuit' (including related 'subcircuit' and 'path'), linear programming, multi-valued decision diagrams (also for dynamic programming subproblems).
