Decision Diagrams can be used to solve many optimization problems using dynamic programming. Recent developments are the development of relaxed and restricted diagrams, which can be used to obtain upper and lower bounds, which then are used in a branch-and-bound scheme. In this MOO we will look at the basics of this branch-and-bound optimization with decision diagrams and apply it to the maximum independent set problem.
