In this session I'll introduce the evaluation tool I've been developing for Pumpkin and other SAT-like solvers, with the idea that we might be able to generalise to other tools. I'll summarise the plans we've made, what I'm using for inspiration, the technology used, how far I've gotten, and finish with a little demo.
