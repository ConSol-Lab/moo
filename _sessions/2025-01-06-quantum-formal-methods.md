In this talk I will go over some of the ways in which formal methods have been applied to quantum computing (with a focus on SAT, #SAT (model counting), Constraint Programming, and temporal planning). Specifically, we will look at previous work on scheduling for both networks and quantum computers, quantum circuit compilation, and quantum circuit analysis.

We will see that formal methods/combinatorial optimisation have been previously applied in the context of quantum computing and that this is a trend which will likely continue in the future.
