In this session, we will go back to the roots of algorithmics and investigate how algorithms have been improved using efficient data structures. We will use the case study of edge finding for the cumulative constraint as an example; in this
work they develop a tree structure which allows efficient computation of certain information leading to an improved algorithm.
