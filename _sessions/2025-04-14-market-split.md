In this session, I will show a class of binary linear programming problems that poses major difficulties to branch-and-cut solvers. We will also discuss the developments induced by this observation, as market split instances have proven helpful
 both for the MIP theory (suggesting a study of lattice-based approaches) and for dynamic programming techniques.
