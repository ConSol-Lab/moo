During this MOO session I will present a paper on using parallel computing to solve large-scale SAT problems. One of the typical ways to exploit parallel computing is to run a portfolio solver, essentially trying many different configurations to race. In this work, however, a method is presented which works well even when all threads run identical configurations.
