The authors present a domain-independent dynamic programming (DP) approach that allows to model DP solutions in a similar way as MIP and CP. In their benchmark of six combinatorial problems (including TSPTW, bin packing, and CVRP) their method can solve more problems to optimality for several domains than CP and MIP. The main limitation for now is memory.
